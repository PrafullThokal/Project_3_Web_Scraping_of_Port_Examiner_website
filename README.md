# Project_3_Web_Scraping_of_Port_Examiner_website

This Python project aims to scrape data from portexaminer.com, a website that provides U.S. Customs import records for millions of real ocean shipments. The goal is to identify suppliers of manufacturing companies to analyze their supply chains.

The focus is on collecting data about five companies: Ford Motor Company, Toyota, Tesla Motors, Mercedes-Benz, and General Motors. The process involves changing the dropdown option from "Supplier Name" to "Importer Name," searching for each company, and parsing the data from the first page of the search results.

The output is expected in a specific format that includes the searched importer, shipper, consignee, notify party, and bill of lading number. However, additional fields can be extracted if time permits.

This project is intended to be automated, and the final output will be stored in a CSV file for further analysis. The code will be shared on GitHub to allow others to replicate the process or improve upon it.
